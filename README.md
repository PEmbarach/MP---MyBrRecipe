# My Br Recipe

>Project developed for the Full Stack Developer - Code Institute course, using only HTML and CSS to build a static webpage.

>The purpose of this webpage is to promote a bit of Brazilian culinary culture, presenting typical dishes from each region of Brazil. 5 different dishes are presented along with the recipe to prepare them, with a list of items and method of preparation. It also has a singup page for a newsletter (which doesn't actually exist).
